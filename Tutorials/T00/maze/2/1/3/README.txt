# Great!
#
# Now, to take one step back, we use
#
#    cd ..
#
# to take two steps back, we use 
#
#    cd ..\..
#
# to take one step back and then enter a new directory fron there, 
# say directory Q, we use
#
#    cd ..\Q
#
# OK, from the maze\2\1\3 directory, using a single cd command, 
# take TWO steps back and then enter the directory 4\0
# which should put you in T00\maze\2\4\0
