#
# Compile and run the NextStep.java program in this directory.
# Follow the directions provided. 
#

# remember, that to compile and then run a java program, we first compile 
# with
# 
#   javac NextStep.java
#
# which, if successful, creates a file.class file. Since this is a program, 
# we run this in the java virtual machine with
#
#   java NextStep
#
# Note: don't put the .class when running it!
